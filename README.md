# Crossword Project

This is meant to be a free online crossword creation tool, since I couldn't find a single decent one online for free.

### TODO for Version 2:

- [x] add NYT crossword rules to Help section
- [ ] make "tab" button switch to next answer
- [ ] detect and recognize a solved puzzle
- [ ] alert user when violating NYT rules (< 3 letter word count, too many words, etc.)
- [ ] drag mouse to add black squares
- [x] move clue boxes next to grid like on NYT page
